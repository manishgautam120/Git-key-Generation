Generating a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"


Ensure the ssh-agent is running. You can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)


Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

If your SSH key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
